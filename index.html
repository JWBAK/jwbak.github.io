    I am an aspiring computer science major! I am enjoying learning about coding in many computer languages, and have recently taken an interest in web design as well.

    I live in Alaska! No, I don't live in an igloo. Thanks for asking.

    In my spare time I like to play video games and enjoy Alaska! Snowboarding, longboarding, hiking!
