# Memory-Game
Created by: Joshua Berry

## Introduction
My take on the classic memory game, where you must flip over several cards until you get pairs that match. I completed this while completing the Front-End Nanodegree Program through Udacity. 
This game was coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

## Dependencies
Font-Awesome 4.6.1

## How to play
Download the files from this repo, and then open the index.html file. 
Likewise you can also play the game on my personal website, by visiting the link below.
